# Drools Usage Patterns
There are 3 ways to use the Drools platform, this project showcases the differences:

1. Embedded/Generate
  * Inspect the `drools-usage-patterns-embedded` project to see how to use rules that are on your classpath
2. Scanner 
  * Inspect the `drools-usage-patterns-scanner` project to see how to use rules that are fetched with maven, potentially changing without updating your code!
3. Remote 
  * Inspect the `drools-usage-patterns-remote` project to see how to create a client for the realtime execution server, introduced in the latest version of Drools.
